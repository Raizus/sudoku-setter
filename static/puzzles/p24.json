If a grey dot is between two unshaded cells their digits are in a 1:2 ratio; if a grey dot is between two shaded cells, their digits are consecutive.\n\n**All Yin Yang Kropki Given**: Cells separated by a a light blue transparent dot indicate that the two connected cells have the same Yin Yang shading. If a grey dot is between two unshaded cells their digits are in a 1:2 ratio; if a grey dot is between two shaded cells, their digits are consecutive. All such dots are given.",
