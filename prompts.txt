Normal sudoku rules apply. Digits MAY repeat in cages if allowed by other rules. The sum of digits in each cage must be a two-digit number that acts as a valid “look-and-say clue” for that cage. Eg if the sum is 21, there must be exactly two 1s in the cage along with any combination of other digits (such that, overall, the digits in the cage sum to 21). Eg2 if the sum is 17, there must be exactly one 7 in the cage along with any combination of other digits (such that, overall, the digits in the cage sum to 17).
