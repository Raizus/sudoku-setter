Normal sudoku rules apply

Divide the grid into 3 zones. Each zone consists of a single group of orthogonally connected cells. No 2x2 area may be entirely within one zone.

The first zone is 'too hot'. Any cell in the hot zone has a value one greater than its digit.

The second zone is 'too cold'. Any cell in the cold zone has a value one less than its digit.

The third zone is 'just right'; this is the Goldilocks Zone. In this zone, a cell's value equals its digit, like normal.

The 9 objects (bowls, chairs and beds) all contain different digits, but each object of the same type has the same value.

Chaos Construction: Divide the grid into regions, each consisting of nine orthogonally-connected cells. Every row, column, and region must contain the digits 1 to 9 once each.

Renbans: Digits along a pink line form a non-repeating consecutive set, but may be written in any order.

Chess Sums: A cell with a number in its top-left corner is a Chess Sums cell. The number in the top-left corner indicates the amount of Chess Sums satisfied by the digit in that cell. A digit in a Chess Sums cell gives one or more of the following:
• The sum of all digits that share its region and are a king’s move away
• The sum of all digits that share its region and are a knight’s move away
• The sum of all digits that share its region and are a bishop’s move away

Clarifications:
• Bishops can “see” past cells from other regions—cells from other regions do not block a bishop’s vision.
• Each Chess Sum is calculated separately. For example, a cell with a “2” clue that contains a 7 can see 4 and 3 by king’s move, and can see 5 and 2 by knight’s move—the king’s move digits and the knight’s move digits each sum to 7 separately.
