Normal Sudoku rules apply.

Draw a one-cell-wide loop of orthogonally connected cells. The loop may not touch itself, not even diagonally.

The loop acts as a German Whisper line, all adjacent digits along the line must have a difference of at least 5.

Clues outside the grid are Loopwiches. Loopwiches indicate the sum of the digts between the first and last loop cell in their row or column. (Both loop and nonloop cells between the 2 crust cells are summed)
