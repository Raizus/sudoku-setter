Going back to the connected_regions predicate, the constraints that you have written are not sufficient to garantee that all 0's form just ONE connected region (same for 0's). This part of the model:
    forall(r in rows, c in cols)(
            % For 0s
            reachable0[r,c] = 
                (is_start0[r,c] \/ 
                (grid[r,c] = 0 /\ 
                    exists(dr in -1..1, dc in -1..1 where abs(dr) + abs(dc) = 1)(
                        r + dr in rows /\ c + dc in cols /\ 
                        reachable0[r+dr,c+dc]
                    ))
                )
        )

will only ensure that every zero has at least one neighbour.

predicate connected(array [$$E] of $$N: from,
                    array [$$E] of $$N: to,
                    array [$$N] of var bool: ns,
                    array [$$E] of var bool: es)

Constrains the subgraph ns and es of a given undirected graph to be connected.

Parameters:

    from: is the leaving node for each edge

    to: is the entering node for each edge

    ns: is a Boolean for each node whether it is in the subgraph

    es: is a Boolean for each edge whether it is in the subgraph
